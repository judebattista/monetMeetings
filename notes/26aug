        Atul
    Park - Meadowbrook? Windsor?
        Allerton? Otherton Park

Look into ECE classes for:
    ML, HW security, privacy

Server:
    Use UIUC VPN to connect to campus nw
    ssh monet@130.126.136.154
    pw monet
    Create own account after logging in

Older server
    monet/monet
    No remote access currently

On campus cluster:
    CSL has four nodes on the campus cluster
    We can get an account to run larger scale computations
    Karen Cromwell to request account
     
UIUC gitlab
    Good place to store large data sets
    
Monet presentation
    Tool: Zeek?
    Paper: from top conference

Start thinking about Quals
    Talk to security lead
