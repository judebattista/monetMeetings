Ask questions!
    Candice knows what's going on in the department

Look into key management, bootstrapping?

Three VMs
    Source
    Sniffer
    Cloud

Triangle Microworks distributed test manager?
    Simulates SCADA communications
    Produce GOOSE, DNP3 traffic

Look into IEC 61850 tools suite

Start by using Atul's dataset

Plan is to have remote access to NREL visualization suite

Grafana has sophisticated query language
    Can call up past alert data
    Lots of Grafana expertise in MONET

Visualization has its own research area

NREL system already has the elastic stack
    Own query system

Beitong works with Grafana/InfluxDB
    There is... another. Who?

Need to start considering visualization techniques for alerts

Shane and Al have visited control centers
    Visualization is still pretty young
        Static lights on wall
            rudimentary
        Massive data stream
            undifferentiated and overwhelming
    System visualization, not security visualization
    Topology map of system
        Can click on a given bus to find out what's going on there
        yellow/red lights to indicate when a system is out of norms
   
Nobody seems to know what the operators need

**************************** 
Next presentation: 
    Atul's tool
        Input
        Output - most important aspect

Arcsight - acquired by HP
    NERC - North American Electrical Reliability 
        Standards the bulk power infra has to adhere to
        Includes security log management
            Arcsight commercially successful here.

    What are they using for logs?
    Pete has a student who might now. Al will email
    We should understand current industry standard solutions
        How is ours different?

In other arenas (multimedia, clean rooms) there are standards around visualizations
    meta data
    clean room: presence of cameras must be announced
        "You are on camera"
    
Understand alerts
    Rank them
